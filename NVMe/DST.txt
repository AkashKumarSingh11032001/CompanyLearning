+++++++ DST FYI +++++++

1. It is a diagostic testing seq that test the intregrity and functionality of the controller as well as if media available with associated namespace.
2. 4 main opertion can be performed: short DST / extended DST / vendor specifc DST / abort DST 
3. DST can be performed @ controller level (0x0), @ specific NS (0x1 - 0xfffffffe) or @ all NS (0xffffffff)
4. CD-10 : bit 0-3 : type of operation to perform (#2)
5. DST command processing:
    DST in progress: Yes
        * Short device self-test / Extended device self-test : Abort with Device Self-test in Progress.
        * Vendor specific: Vendor specific reponse
        * Abort device self-test: 
            + Abort dst in progress
            + creat log entry
            + set current DST status field to 0h in DST log.
            + complete command succesfully
    DST in progress: No
        * Short device self-test :
            + validate cmd parameter
            + set current DST status field to 1h in DST log.
            + start dst
            + complete command succesfully
        * Extended device self-test :
            + validate cmd parameter
            + set current DST status field to 2h in DST log.
            + start dst
            + complete command succesfully
        * Vendor specific: Vendor specific
        * Abort device self-test: Completes command successfully
6. A device self-test operation is performed in the background allowing concurrent processing of some commands but some command requre suspension of DST operation.
    in that case Controler will follow following steps:
        + suspend DST
        + process and complete requested cojmand
        + resume DST
7. Short DST:
    + It should complete in 2 min or less.
    + short DST wil be aborted bt any controller level resets, format nvme cmd, sanitize opr.
8. Extended DSt:
    + It should complete in within the time indictated in Extended dst time field in identify controller data structure.
    + extended dst will persist across any controller level reset and will resume after reset or restoration of power.
    + extended dst will be abborted by format nvme, sanitize opr, dst with self test code set to 0xFh
9. Following operation is been performed during DST.
    + Ram check [ short + extended only ]
    + SMART check [ short + extended only ]
    + Volatile memory backup [ short + extended only ]
    + Metadata validation [ short + extended only ] 
    + NVM integrity [ short + extended only ]
    + Media Check [ short + extended only ]
    + Drive Life [ short + extended only ]
    + Data Integrity [ extended only ]
10. DST will run over the loop and each loop/ iteration log page will be listed to dst log data structure after 2 field. so total 20 DST iteration is supported.
