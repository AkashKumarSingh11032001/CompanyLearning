1. Purpose: Sanitize operations permanently erase all user data from an NVMe subsystem, making it unrecoverable.
2. Scope: The operation affects all areas where user data can be stored, including caches, persistent memory, and unallocated media.
3. Irreversibility: Once started, a sanitize operation cannot be aborted and continues even after power cycles or controller resets.
4. Background Process: Sanitize operations are performed in the background, and their completion is indicated by asynchronous events or log page updates.
5. Supported Types: NVMe supports three sanitize operation types: Block Erase, Crypto Erase, and Overwrite.
    + Types         Block Erase        Crypto Erase                                Overwrite
    + Purpose       Erase all blocks   Erase all blocks with cryptographic erase   Overwrite all blocks with random data
    + Security      Moderate           High                                        Less than Crypto erase
    + Endurance     High               High                                        Moderate
    + performance   Fast               Slower                                      Avg
6. Media-Specific: The Overwrite sanitize operation may not be suitable for all media types due to potential endurance issues.
7. No-Deallocate Option: The No-Deallocate After Sanitize option allows for media modifications after a successful sanitize operation.
8. Sanitize Status Log Page: This log page provides information about the progress and status of sanitize operations.
9. Asynchronous Events: The controller generates asynchronous events to notify the host about the completion of sanitize operations.
10. Recovery: A failed sanitize operation can be recovered from by starting a subsequent sanitize operation or using the Exit Failure Mode action.
11. sanitize operation starts on any controller, all controllers in the NVM subsystem follow belows rules
    + clear any outstanding sanitize opr.
    + update sanitize log.
    + abort any command.
    + abort dst.
    + suspend autonomous power state management activites.

13. Sanitize flow : 
            To start a sanitize operation, the host submits a Sanitize command specifying one of the sanitize operation 
            types (i.e., Block Erase, Overwrite, or Crypto Erase). The host sets command parameters, including the 
            Allow Unrestricted Sanitize Exit bit and the No-Deallocate After Sanitize bit. After validating the Sanitize 
            command parameters, the controller starts the sanitize operation in the background, updates the Sanitize 
            Status log page and then completes the Sanitize command with Successful Completion status. If the 
            sanitize operation is to be followed by an associated additional media modification operation (refer to 
            NODMMAS in Figure 275), then the associated additional media modification operation shall be completed 
            before the controller reports sanitize operation complete. If a Sanitize command is completed with any 
            status code other than Successful Completion, then the controller shall not start the sanitize operation and 
            shall not update the Sanitize Status log page. The controller ignores Critical Warning(s) in the SMART / 
            Health Information log page (e.g., read only mode) and attempts to complete the sanitize operation 
            requested.


Key Term:
1. Endurance in the context of NVMe storage refers to the number of write cycles a storage device can withstand before its performance starts to degrade significantly
